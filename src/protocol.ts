/**
 * The VPS relay <-> Cloudflare Worker wire protocol.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS A TWIN. An identical copy lives at `server/src/protocol.ts`, and
 * `npm run verify:relay` asserts the two are byte-for-byte identical. Edit one,
 * copy it to the other, in the same commit. Silent drift here produces a relay
 * that closes every connection with an unhelpful code, which is close to the
 * least debuggable failure this system can have.
 *
 * It is deliberately runtime-agnostic: no `node:` imports, no Workers globals,
 * nothing but TextEncoder/TextDecoder and typed arrays, so the same bytes are
 * produced by Node and by workerd.
 *
 * Shape of a session:
 *
 *   1. VPS opens a WebSocket to the Worker. The URL is bare - no query params,
 *      no subprotocol. Both of those get written to request logs by Cloudflare
 *      and by anything in between, and frame 0 carries proxy credentials.
 *   2. VPS sends frame 0: the AES-256-GCM sealed DialRequest.
 *   3. Worker replies READY (one byte) or ERROR (code + message), the latter
 *      followed immediately by a close with the matching 4xxx code.
 *   4. After READY, every frame in both directions is raw tunnel bytes with no
 *      tag at all - a binary message simply IS a chunk of the TCP stream. The
 *      Worker never sends a control frame again, so there is no ambiguity about
 *      whether a post-READY frame is data. Failures from here on are signalled
 *      by close code alone.
